            Van Helsing is a 2004 American action horror film directed by
            Stephen Sommers. It stars Hugh Jackman as Gabriel Van Helsing, a
            monster hunter tasked by the Vatican to help a beautiful woman, Anna
            Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), destroy the powerful vampire Count
            Dracula (Richard Roxburgh). The film is set in the late 19th century
            Transylvania. Van Helsing is sent by the Vatican to help Anna and
            her family, who have been tasked for generations to kill Dracula and
            his brides. Dracula has made a pact with the evil Mr. Hyde, and
            together they plot to take over the world. Van Helsing teams up with
            Anna and her gypsy friend Carl to battle Dracula, his brides, and
            Mr. Hyde. They must use an array of high-tech gadgets and weapons to
            try to defeat the powerful supernatural forces. Along the way, Van
            Helsing discovers that he has a mysterious past connected to
            Dracula. The film features extensive action sequences, special
            effects, and supernatural elements as Van Helsing fights to stop
            Dracula's plans and break his family's centuries-old curse. It is a
            gothic, monster-filled adventure that pits the skilled Van Helsing
            against the iconic vampire Count Dracula.
