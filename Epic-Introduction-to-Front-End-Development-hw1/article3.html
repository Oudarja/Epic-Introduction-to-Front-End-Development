            Niagara Falls is a group of three large waterfalls on the border
            between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of New
            York. The three waterfalls are the American Falls, the Bridal Veil
            Falls, and the Canadian (or Horseshoe) Falls. Niagara Falls is one
            of the most powerful waterfalls in the world, with an average water
            flow rate of over 3,000 tons of water per second. The falls are
            situated on the Niagara River, which flows from Lake Erie to Lake
            Ontario. The height of the Horseshoe Falls is approximately 167 feet
            (51 m). Niagara Falls is a popular tourist destination, attracting
            millions of visitors each year to see the impressive natural wonder
            and enjoy activities like boat tours, hiking, and views from the
            observation decks. In addition to its natural beauty, Niagara Falls
            has also been used to generate hydroelectric power, with several
            power stations located near the falls. The area around Niagara Falls
            has a long history, with evidence of Native American settlements
            dating back thousands of years in the region. Let me know if you
            need any other details about this iconic natural landmark.
