            Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that allows
            computers to learn and improve from experience without being
            explicitly programmed. It involves developing algorithms and
            statistical models that enable systems to perform specific tasks
            effectively without relying on rule-based programming. Machine
            learning algorithms use data, known as training data, to build
            models that can make predictions or decisions. These models are then
            used to analyze new, unseen data and make inferences or predictions
            about it. The process of training the model on the data and then
            applying it to new data is at the core of machine learning.
