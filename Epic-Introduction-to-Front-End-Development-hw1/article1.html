            Homer was an ancient Greek poet who is believed to have lived around
            the 8th century BCE. He is credited with writing two of the most
            famous and influential epic poems of all time - the Iliad and the
            Odyssey. The Iliad tells the story of the Trojan War, focusing on
            the final weeks of a 10-year siege of the city of Troy. It is
            considered a foundational work of Western literature. The Odyssey
            follows the journey of the Greek hero Odysseus as he tries to make
            his way home after the Trojan War. It is an adventure epic that has
            had a massive impact on subsequent literature. Homer's exact dates
            are uncertain, but most scholars agree he lived in the 8th century
            BCE, making him one of the earliest known Greek writers. His poems
            were originally passed down orally for generations before being
            written down, likely in the 6th century BCE. Homer's works used a
            unique poetic form called dactylic hexameter, which became the
            standard for Greek epic poetry. This metrical style contributes to
            the elevated, majestic quality of his language. Both the Iliad and
            Odyssey were hugely influential on Greek and Roman literature, as
            well as the entire Western literary tradition. They remain
            foundational texts that are still widely studied today.
